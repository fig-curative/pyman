# pyman

pyman is an implementation of hangman in python which pulls a random secret word from a provided wordlist text file and then allows you to guess the letters contained within it

pyman ver 1 has limitations:
1. the player only gets three guesses before being hanged
2. wordlist.txt contains only a single word
